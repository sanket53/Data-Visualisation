    "## 2. Project Dashboard\n",
    "A project dashboard is a visual picture of the performance pointers (KPIs) for a project. It allows managers to track the development of a project, identify possible problems, and make well-versed decisions. A well-designed dashboard should be easy to read, understand, and use. The Food Order Optimization Hub Dashboard presented here is a tool for managers and consultants, providing key visualizations that helps in decision-making by using effective media and organizing information briefly, the design optimizes human memory and perception, ensuring quick and accurate analysis.\n",
    "### Using the Monitor, Analyse, Drill to detail design principles-\n",

    "## 7. Review of Chosen Datasets \n",
    "Refer Table of Links (Dataset) which is at the start of the document.\n",
    "The Dataset I found was from Kaggle.com which was of a NYC food ordering application and secondary data set was of Zomato which is also similar food delivery application from India for 1 Month.\n",
    "I achieved the goal of my objective using these 2 datasets with different geographical region but with similar type of requirements in the application and the similar goal of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relevance: The datasets contained information about order data, restaurant information, and food which are all relevant factors to consider when analysing the performance of a food delivery application business.\n",
    "2. Complete: The datasets were fairly complete, with minimal missing or erroneous values. This allowed for correct and dependable analysis of the data.\n",
    "3. Format: The datasets were consistent in format and structure, which made it easy to combine and analyse the data from different sources.\n",
    "4. Size: The datasets were of a moderate size, which allowed for effective analysis using the chosen tools and technologies.\n",
    "5. Real-world: The datasets were based on real-world data from a food delivery application business, which gave the analysis a real-world and related application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with the datasets was generally straightforward and efficient. The data was clean and well-organized, and the chosen tools and technologies were well-suited for the task. However, there were a few challenges that arose during the analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integrity: Keeping graphical integrity in mind did not plot any wrong data or did any extensive modification to the data which will change its origin.\n",
    "2. Inconsistent Data Types: The data types were consistent across the datasets, but there were a few instances where data was encoded in an unexpected format. But luckily the data was not required anywhere in my visualisation.\n",
    "3. Understanding the Data: The different variables in the data were complex and required careful analysis to identify patterns and trends. This was accomplished using exploratory data analysis techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining both datasets improved the analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the food ordering scenery.\n",

    "## 8. Visualisation of Data with Accompanying Code\n",
    "In the Food Order Optimization Hub Dashboard, various key visualizations have been combined to deliver a wide range view of the data. Each visualization is strategically chosen to address specific aspects of the food ordering process to the needs of managers and consultants. Below are some key visualizations along with the corresponding Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code 1- Average Price per Cuisine Type Ordered in a Month:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why Chosen: This line chart provides a high-level overview of Total order prices for different cuisine types which helps managers to identify trends and allocate resources effectively.\n",
    "2. How Created: Using plotly.express the code plots a line chart with cuisine types on the x-axis, average prices on the y-axis, and markers for accurate view of the data.\n",
    "3. Color Used:I used Green color for line and Red color for the marker, because I thought in most of the cases the color for food displayed with Veg as Green or Non-veg food as Red. So combining those two color felt using it would be nice in my visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code 2- Distribution of Cuisine Type / City / Day type-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why Chosen: Bar chart representing the percentage distribution of data in a very appropriate manner.\n",
    "2. How Created: The custom function which I have re-used to plot 3 bar graphs representing the percentage distribution of data.\n",
    "3. Graphical Integrity: To maintain the Graphical integrity of the graph added the calculation of percentage and then the addition of all the bars should be 100%.\n",
    "4. Color Used: I have used different colors to represent different bars which seems very attractive.\n",
    "5. Percentage: Adding the percentage representation over the top of every bar helps to find the accurate and exact data representation and helping viewers grasp the output of the data very quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chosen visualizations are intentionally selected to cover various sides of the food ordering data, from pricing trends and restaurant performance to category distribution and geographical insights. The inclusion of line charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts ensures a diverse yet cohesive representation of the data simplifying a detailed analysis for decision-makers in the food hub application ops.\n"

    "Lessons Learned:\n",
    "The project provided a valuable learning experience in data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "1. Importance of data quality: Clean and accurate data is essential for any analysis.\n",
    "2. Data investigation: Data analysis can discover hidden patterns and understandings in data.\n",

    "Analytics and visualization are valuable tools for managers and consultants. They can be used to make well-versed decisions, solve problems and improve business performance.Most popular cuisines among customers this information can be used to focus marketing efforts on those cuisines.Restaurants getting most orders this information can be used to focus marketing efforts on those restaurants.Analysed the distribution of orders by day of the week this information can be used to plan staffing accordingly.Orders per city this information can be used to target advertising in specific cities.\n",
